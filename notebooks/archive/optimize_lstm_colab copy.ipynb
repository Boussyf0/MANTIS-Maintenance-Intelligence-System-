The model should have two LSTM layers (64 and 32 units, each followed by a 0.2 dropout), a Dense layer (16 units, ReLU activation), and a final Dense output layer (1 unit, linear activation). Compile the model with the Adam optimizer, 'mse' loss, and 'mae' metrics. Train this model for 50 epochs with a batch size of 128, using a 0.2 validation split directly during training. Log the model's performance (RMSE and MAE) to MLflow under the `MANTIS_RUL_Prediction_Keras` experiment, and then summarize the achieved RMSE and MAE, comparing them against expected results from the article if available."

The `RULModel` class defined a standard LSTM architecture with `input_size`, `hidden_size`, `num_layers`, and an `output_size` (fixed at 1). It consisted of `nn.LSTM` layers followed by a `nn.Linear` layer for the final output. This PyTorch model was used in a hyperparameter grid search to explore different combinations of `hidden_size`, `num_layers`, and `learning_rate`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subsequent shift involved transitioning to a **Keras LSTM model**, primarily for establishing a fixed architecture, potentially based on recommendations from an external article or to serve as a strong baseline for comparison. This transition required replacing the PyTorch model definition with a Keras Sequential model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Fixed Keras LSTM Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The chosen fixed Keras LSTM architecture is defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Input Layer**: Explicitly defined using `keras.Input(shape=input_shape)` as the first layer. This resolves a `UserWarning` encountered previously regarding the `input_shape` argument when directly passing it to the first `LSTM` layer in a `Sequential` model. By using `keras.Input`, the model clearly understands the expected input dimensions.\n",
        "*   **First LSTM Layer**: Consists of 64 units. It is configured with `return_sequences=True` to ensure that the output of this layer is a sequence, which is necessary when stacking multiple LSTM layers.\n",
        "*   **First Dropout Layer**: A `Dropout` layer with a rate of 0.2 is added immediately after the first LSTM layer to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "*   **Second LSTM Layer**: Contains 32 units and is configured with `return_sequences=False` since it is the last LSTM layer in the sequence. Its output is therefore a single vector representing the last time step's output.\n",
        "*   **Second Dropout Layer**: Another `Dropout` layer with a rate of 0.2 follows the second LSTM layer for regularization.\n",
        "*   **Dense Layer**: A fully connected `Dense` layer with 16 units and `relu` activation function. This layer helps in extracting higher-level features from the LSTM outputs.\n",
        "*   **Output Layer**: A final `Dense` layer with 1 unit and `linear` activation. This layer is responsible for outputting the single RUL prediction value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer**, with `'mse'` (Mean Squared Error) as the loss function and `'mae'` (Mean Absolute Error) as a metric for evaluation. The `activation='relu'` was originally specified in the Keras model definition for the LSTM layers, though the default `tanh` activation is often suitable and sometimes preferred for LSTMs for better convergence, as reflected in a later modification in the provided code where `activation` was removed from LSTM layers to use the default. The dense layer correctly uses `relu` and the final output layer uses `linear` for regression.\n",

Key hyperparameters such as `epochs`, `batch_size`, and `validation_split` are logged using `mlflow.log_params()`. Performance metrics, specifically the `best_val_rmse` and `best_val_mae`, are logged as `mlflow.log_metric()` at the end of each run.

If the `val_loss` does not improve for `10` consecutive epochs (patience=10), training is halted prematurely. Crucially, `restore_best_weights=True` ensures that the model weights from the epoch with the best `val_loss` are restored before training concludes.\n",
